bbs-8 is also required for the proper regulation of insulin secretion; bbs-8, bbs-5, bbs-1, and bbs-9 mutants along with ciliary phenotypes show an increased secretion of insulin, biogenic amines and neuropeptides, which requires the Rab27/AEX-6 dense-core vesicle exocytosis machinery.", "inx-19 encodes an innexin, proteins that form gap junction channels;

osm-5 is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and localizes to the transition zones of the amphids, phasmids, labials and rays of the male tail; osm-5 expression is regulated by the RFX-type transcription factor, DAF-19, that also regulates the expression of other genes involved in cilia formation.", "ast-1 encodes one of ten C. elegans ETS-box transcription factors;
